### What is sentiment analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing, text analysis, and statistics to analyze customer sentiment. The best businesses understand the sentiment of their customers—what people are saying, how they’re saying it, and what they mean. Customer sentiment can be found in tweets, comments, reviews, or other places where people mention your brand. Sentiment Analysis is the domain of understanding these emotions with software, and it’s a must-understand for developers and business leaders in a modern workplace.
